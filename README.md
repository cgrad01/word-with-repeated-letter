# word-with-repeated-letter

In this challenge, I was asked to write a function that takes a text file input, and outputs the word in that file that contains the most repeats of a single letter (in the case of a tie, return the first occurring word in the original file). I assume that the file would contain a-z (upper and lower), whitespace, and punctuation. I also assume that a letter is the same letter regardless of case.

In order to run this program:

  1. Clone the respository to your desktop.
  2. In your terminal, navigate into the folder titled "word-with-repeated-letter"
  3. In the command line, enter "ruby runner.rb"
  4. Follow the instructions.

  ** Please note, in order to add a new input file, please copy that file into this folder first **

Thanks!
